```{r packages, results="hide"}
rm(list = ls())

# load packages 
for (pkg in c("tidyverse", "igraph", "visNetwork", "data.table", "R.utils", 
              "RPostgreSQL", "cowplot", "maditr", "stringr", "stringi", "gridExtra")) {library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)}
```

```{r loading_data}
# connect to postgresql to get our data
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))

# query the users_gh data from github data 
users_gh <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT login, email, company
                              FROM gh.ctrs_extra")

institutions_hipolabs <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT institution, country, domains FROM hipolabs.universities")

# disconnect from postgresql database 
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

First, cleaning hipolabs data before comparing it with github users.

```{r clean_hipolabs}
institutions_hipolabs <- institutions_hipolabs %>% 
  as.data.table() %>% 
  # convert to lower case
  dt_mutate(institution = str_to_lower(institution)) %>%
  # remove duplicates
  distinct() %>%
  # add category for students
  add_row(institution = "misc. student") %>%
  # add academic/research organizations present in users_gh but not in hipo labs data
  add_row(institution = "university of tokyo", country = "Japan", domains = "u-tokyo.ac.jp") %>%
  add_row(institution = "aalto university", country = "Finland", domains = "aalto.fi") %>%
  add_row(institution = "international institute of information technology, hyderabad", country = "India", domains = "iiit.ac.in") %>%
  #add_row(institution = "broad institute", country = "United States", domains = "broadinstitute.org") %>%
  #add_row(institution = "cern", country = "Switzerland", domains = "cern.ch") %>%
  #add_row(institution = "inria", country = "France", domains = "inria.fr") %>%
  #add_row(institution = "cnrs", country = "France", domains = "cnrs.fr") %>%
  add_row(institution = "space telescope science institute", country = "United States", domains = "stsci.edu") %>%
  #add_row(institution = "wellcome trust sanger institute", country = "United Kingdom", domains = "sanger.ac.uk") %>%
  add_row(institution = "hasso plattner institute", country = "Germany", domains = "hpi.de") %>%
  dt_mutate(institution = if_else(institution == "xi'an university of electronic science and technology", "xidian university", institution))
#setwd("~/git/oss-2020/data/academic/")
#write_csv(institutions_hipolabs, "hipolabs.csv")
```

Looking at the total numbers before any recoding.

```{r initial_counts}
length(users_gh$company) 
# 2,143,407 total entries 
# note: there are actually 2,435,698 total users

valid_company_codes <- users_gh %>% drop_na(company) 
length(valid_company_codes$company)
# 422517 users with some company_code information 
length(valid_company_codes$company) / length(users_gh$company)
# putting us at 19.7124% that are identifiable for now 

# organize by company
orgs_initial <- users_gh %>% 
  drop_na(company) %>% 
  dt_mutate(organization = str_to_lower(company)) %>% 
  group_by(organization) %>% count() %>% arrange(-n)

# compare with hipo labs dataset
initial_overlap <- semi_join(orgs_initial, institutions_hipolabs, by = c("organization" = "institution"))
sum(initial_overlap[,"n"])
# 16,677 identified users from academic institutions
```

Recoding the companies in users_gh, using string matching to catch name variations.

```{r regex_recode}
orgs_clean <- users_gh %>%
  # remove all na's 
  drop_na(company) %>% 
  # convert to lower case 
  dt_mutate(organization = str_to_lower(company)) %>%

                              yes = "wissenschaftliche hochschule für unternehmensführung, otto-beisheim hochschule", no = organization))

# create a frequency table
org_counts <- orgs_clean %>% group_by(organization) %>% count() %>% arrange(-n) 

# compare with hipo labs dataset to pull out academic institutions
institutions_hipolabs <- institutions_hipolabs %>% as.data.table() %>% dt_mutate(institution = str_to_lower(institution))
overlap <- semi_join(org_counts, institutions_hipolabs, by = c("organization" = "institution"))
sum(overlap[,"n"])
sum(filter(overlap, organization != "misc. student")[,"n"])
filter(overlap, organization == "misc. student")$n

# make a table to see what isn't caught by hipo labs
leftover <- anti_join(org_counts, overlap)
```

At this point, we have 28,641 users in the academic sector: 27,077 matched to academic institutions and 1,564 identified as misc. students.

We can boost this number by looking at the users' email domains.

```{r domains_recode}
# get just the domains from the emails
email_domains <- users_gh %>% drop_na(email) %>%
dt_mutate(domains = str_replace_all(email, "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@", ""))

# match academic institutions from hipolabs to users based on email domains
# only impute company when it was NA
imputed_institutions <- email_domains %>%
  as.data.table() %>%
  inner_join(drop_na(institutions_hipolabs, domains)) %>%
  subset(is.na(company)) %>%
  dt_mutate(organization = institution)

nrow(imputed_institutions)
# 11,632 imputed

# join with other recoded data to update academic counts
orgs_clean <- full_join(orgs_clean, imputed_institutions[,c("login","email","organization")])
org_counts <- orgs_clean %>% group_by(organization) %>% count() %>% arrange(-n) 
overlap <- semi_join(org_counts, institutions_hipolabs, by = c("organization" = "institution"))
sum(overlap[,"n"])
```

New total is 40,273 users in the academic sector.

At this point, we can make a table of users in the academic sector to push to our database.

```{r final_table}
final_table <- orgs_clean %>%
  semi_join(institutions_hipolabs, by = c("organization" = "institution")) %>%
  transmute(login = login, company_raw = company, company_cleaned = organization, is_academic = 1)
```

Now that we have the counts for GitHub users at academic institutions, we'd like to recombine this with the Hipo Labs data to get the country locations for these institutions.

```{r get_countries}
# rejoin with hipo labs data
academic_counts <- overlap %>%
  left_join(institutions_hipolabs, by = c("organization" = "institution")) %>% 
  filter(!(organization == "misc. student")) # remove misc. students for future analyses

sum(academic_counts[,"n"]) 
# now there are 42,966 users?
# larger than before because it's double-counting the institutions that are in multiple countries or have multiple domains

# group together different country and domain values for the same institution
group1 <- academic_counts[duplicated(academic_counts$organization), ] %>% rename(c(country2 = country, domains2 = domains))
group2 <- group1[duplicated(group1$organization), ] %>% rename(c(country3 = country2, domains3 = domains2))
group3 <- group2[duplicated(group2$organization), ] %>% rename(c(country4 = country3, domains4 = domains3))
group4 <- group3[duplicated(group3$organization), ] %>% rename(c(country5 = country4, domains5 = domains4))

# remove duplicates so each group has unique values
group1 <- group1[!duplicated(group1$organization), ]
group2 <- group2[!duplicated(group2$organization), ]
group3 <- group3[!duplicated(group3$organization), ]
group4 <- group4[!duplicated(group4$organization), ]

# add back in the multiple countries/domains, but as additional columns
# now there is only one row for each institution
academic_counts <- academic_counts[!duplicated(academic_counts$organization), ] %>% 
  left_join(group1) %>%
  left_join(group2) %>%
  left_join(group3) %>%
  left_join(group4)

# add NAs for when multiple country listings are the same (if the duplicated institution is from multiple domains)
# or when multiple domain listings are the same (if the duplicated institution is from multiple countries)
academic_counts <- academic_counts %>%
  mutate_all(str_replace_na) %>%
  dt_mutate(country2 = if_else(country == country2, "NA", country2)) %>%
  dt_mutate(country3 = if_else(country == country3, "NA", country3)) %>%
  dt_mutate(domains2 = if_else(domains == domains2, "NA", domains2)) %>%
  dt_mutate(domains3 = if_else(domains == domains3, "NA", domains3)) %>%
  dt_mutate(domains4 = if_else(domains == domains4, "NA", domains4)) %>%
  dt_mutate(domains5 = if_else(domains == domains5, "NA", domains5))

# collapse into single columns for country/domains
# we want to avoid having multiple countries for an institution, since they'd be double-counted in the following analyses
# for the 21 institutions represented that are in multiple countries, the primary country is manually coded
academic_counts <- academic_counts %>%
  dt_mutate(country = if_else(condition = organization %chin% c("universidad simón bolivar", "suleyman demirel university", "universidad de córdoba", "aga khan university", "southeast university", "universidad de los andes", "korea university"), true = country2, false = country)) %>%
  dt_mutate(domains_combined = str_c(domains, domains2, domains3, domains4, domains5, sep = ", ")) %>%
  transmute(organization = organization, n = n, country = country, domains = domains_combined)

# remove remaining NAs
academic_counts <- academic_counts %>% 
  dt_mutate(domains = str_replace_all(domains, ", NA", "")) %>%
  dt_mutate(n = as.numeric(n)) # for some reason n got changed to chr type
```

Create nodelist for network analysis

```{r}
academic_institution_nodelist <- academic_counts %>%
  select(-domains) %>%
  rename(Id = organization)

write_csv(academic_institution_nodelist, "academic_institution_nodelist_gephi.csv")
```

Now let's look at some statistics.

```{r stats}
length(filter(academic_counts, country == "United States")$organization) / length(academic_counts$organization)
# 33% of academic institutions represented are in the U.S.
sum(filter(academic_counts, country == "United States")[, "n"]) / sum(academic_counts[, "n"])
# 55% of users in the academic sector are at U.S. institutions
sum(academic_counts[,"n"]) / 2435698
# 1.6% of all users have been matched to an academic institution

# look at percentage of academic sector users in each country
options(scipen = 10)
country_user_percentages <- academic_counts %>% group_by(country) %>% select(country, n) %>% summarise(n = sum(n) / sum(academic_counts[, "n"])) %>% arrange(-n)
country_user_percentages
```

Finally, let's plot some of this stuff.

```{r, top_ten, fig.width = 12}
academic_counts_sorted <- academic_counts %>% 
  arrange(n) %>%
  dt_mutate(organization = factor(organization, levels = organization))

  labs(x = "Academic institution", 
       y = "User count", 
       title = "Top 10 universities by users") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, by_country, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 12}

  scale_color_manual(values = c("United States" = "#485C99", "China" = "#E57200", "Canada" = "#12B2CE")) +
  labs(x = "Academic Institution", y = "Number of Users", color = "Country", title = "Top 20 universities by number of users") +
  #theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, us_universities, fig.height=7}

  labs(x = "Academic Institution", y = "Number of Users", title = "Top 20 universities in the United States") +
  theme_classic() +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r, countries_users, fig.height=7}
#country_frequency_institutions <- academic_counts %>% group_by(country) %>% count(wt = n(), sort = TRUE)

country_frequency_users <- academic_counts %>% group_by(country) %>% count(sort = TRUE, wt = n)
country_users_sorted <- country_frequency_users %>%

  theme_classic() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
