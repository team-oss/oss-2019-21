### Creating the relational hierarchy 

I am cutting gov level by gov level rather than doing this all column by column. Its more code but (1) I want to validate what I see in each step and (2) I want all of the organizations standardized for use outside of this context. 

```{r}
# let's start with the white house council 
wh_br_ag <- us_gov_azindex_dedup %>% 
  filter(agency == "white house") %>% 
  select(branch, agency) %>% 
  rename(from=branch, to=agency) %>% 
  group_by(from, to) %>% 
  count() %>% rename(weight = n)

# then white house to depts 
wh_ag_inst <- us_gov_azindex_dedup %>% 
  filter(agency == "white house") %>% 
  select(agency, unique_institution) %>% 
  rename(from=agency, to=unique_institution) %>% 
  group_by(from, to) %>% 
  count() %>% rename(weight = n)

# then to the 15 executive departmnents 
executive_depts <- c("u.s. department of agriculture", "u.s. department of commerce", "u.s. department of defense",
                     "u.s. department of education", "u.s. department of energy", "u.s. department of health and human services",
                     "u.s. department of homeland security", "u.s. department of housing and urban development", "u.s. department of justice",
                     "u.s. department of labor", "u.s. department of the interior", "u.s. department of state",

  select(branch, agency) %>% 
  rename(from=branch, to=agency) %>% 
  group_by(from, to) %>% 
  count() %>% rename(weight = n)

# then connect the exec depts to their exec subagencies 
exec_depts_subag <- us_gov_azindex_dedup %>% 
  filter(branch == "u.s. executive branch" & agency %in% executive_depts) %>% 
  select(agency, subagency) %>% 
  rename(from=agency, to=subagency) %>% 
  drop_na(to) %>% 
  group_by(from, to) %>%

# then the exec subagencies to unique institutions

  group_by(from, to) %>% 
  count() %>% rename(weight = n)

# then the exec depts to unique institutions without subagencies
exec_ag_inst <- us_gov_azindex_dedup %>% 
  filter(branch == "u.s. executive branch" & agency %in% executive_depts) %>% 
  filter(is.na(subagency)) %>% 
  select(agency, unique_institution) %>% 
  rename(from=agency, to=unique_institution) %>% 
  filter(is.na(from)) %>% 
  group_by(from, to) %>% 
  count() %>% rename(weight = n)

# do subagency-institution 
# do agency-institution when subagency NA  
 

wh_exec <- rbind(wh_br_ag, wh_ag_inst, exec_depts, exec_depts_subag, exec_subag_inst, exec_ag_inst)

```
```{r}

# Brandon ==== Just filtered out the self-loop duplicates across the columns. The graph above shows all the WH and Exec Branch ties
# Next step is standardize all the institution names in exec_subag_inst and exec_ag_inst (starting with the natinonal institute of corrections)
# Then to map the judicial and legislation branches and then add them back into the network 
# Once the AZ index is cleaned, you need to add the scraped AZ data, the curated AZ data and the cleaned AZ data to standardizeR and share with Ledia
