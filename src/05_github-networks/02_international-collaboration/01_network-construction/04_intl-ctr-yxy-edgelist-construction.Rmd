                                      destination = 'country.name')

# changing Kosovo to have a valid country name 
intl_ctr_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  mutate(country1 = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = ctrycode1, 
                          pattern = "xk"), yes = "Kosovo", no = country1)) %>%  
  mutate(country2 = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = ctrycode2,

  select(ctr1, ctrycode1, country1, ctr2, ctrycode2, country2, year, repo_wts)

#create sna_intl_ctr_edgelist
sna_intl_ctr_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  select(ctr1, ctr2, year, repo_wts)

```

Before we write these edgelists to the database, let's make sure that these can be converted to networks in igraph. igraph requires the nodelist and edgelist to match when you draw from both and I find this to be a good test that all the data is aligned. 

```{r}

# we will bring together our new intl_ctr_network & original nodelist (without the country_codes split into new rows)
intl_ctr_network <- graph_from_data_frame(d=sna_intl_ctr_edgelist, vertices=ctr_nodelist, directed=FALSE) 

```

Now that we know the nodelists and edgelists converge to form networks, we can write them to the database.

```{r writing_intl_edgelist, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# connect to postgresql to get data (in rivanna)
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))

# write the edgelist to the database
dbWriteTable(conn, name = c(schema = "gh" , name = "sna_intl_ctr_edgelist_yxy"), 
             value = sna_intl_ctr_edgelist, row.names = FALSE, temporary = TRUE)

# disconnect from postgresql
dbDisconnect(conn)

```

# Note that the contributor and country nodelists are in 02_international-collaboration > 01_data-cleaning folder.
