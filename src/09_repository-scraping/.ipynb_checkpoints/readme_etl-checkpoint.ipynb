       "'React ·    \\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\\n\\nDeclarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\\nComponent-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\\nLearn Once, Write Anywhere: We don\\'t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\\n\\nLearn how to use React in your own project.\\nInstallation\\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:\\n\\nUse Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.\\nAdd React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute.\\nCreate a New React App if you\\'re looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\\n\\nYou can use React as a <script> tag from a CDN, or as a react package on npm.\\nDocumentation\\nYou can find the React documentation on the website.\\nCheck out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.\\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\\n\\nTutorial\\nMain Concepts\\nAdvanced Guides\\nAPI Reference\\nWhere to Get Support\\nContributing Guide\\n\\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.\\nExamples\\nWe have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:\\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(\\n  <HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" />,\\n  document.getElementById(\\'container\\')\\n);\\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\\nYou\\'ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you\\'re using React as a <script> tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.\\nContributing\\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\\nCode of Conduct\\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\\nContributing Guide\\nRead our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\\nGood First Issues\\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.\\nLicense\\nReact is MIT licensed.\\n'"

       "'The Rise of Diversity and Population Terminology in Biomedical Research\\nAs of: 05-17-2021\\nThis repository provides the source code for the Brandon Kramer and Catherine Lee\\'s \"The Rise of Diversity and Population Terminology in Biomedical Research.\" After uploading the PubMed/MEDLINE database with PubMedPortable in Python, we used R\\'s tidytext package to examine trends in the use of diversity in more than 2.5 million scientific abstracts from 1990-2020. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that various types of \"diversity\" and other population terminiology, including race and ethnicity, are rising over time. While we provide some prelimiary results and a full appendix on our project website, the source code, database, and outputs are detailed below.

      "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n",
      "Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n",
      "Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\n",
      "Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\n",
      "Learn how to use React in your own project.\n",
      "Installation\n",
      "React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:\n",
      "Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.\n",
      "Add React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute.\n",
      "Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\n",
      "You can use React as a <script> tag from a CDN, or as a react package on npm.\n",
      "Documentation\n",
      "You can find the React documentation on the website.\n",
      "Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.\n",

      "Examples\n",
      "We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:\n",
      "function HelloMessage({ name }) {\n",

      "  <HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" />,\n",
      "  document.getElementById('container')\n",
      ");\n",
      "This example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\n",
      "You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a <script> tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.\n",
