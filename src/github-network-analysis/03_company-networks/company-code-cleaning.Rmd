```

This suggests that only 15% of the data has valid information in the company column. 

```{r}
users_gh %>% filter(is.na(company))
```

When we look at the logins with missing company data, we can find out more about them on their GitHub profiles. A quick check of these top login sites shows that there is additional information out there in their profiles that we could use to identify sector information. For now, let's just try to categorize what we have. 

# Codifying the Data into Sectors 

The original sectors from the GitHub project in Summer 2019 are business, nonprofit, government, university and individual/private. Let's see if we can get some estimates.
