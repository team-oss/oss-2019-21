title: "PostgreSQL Code for Repos per Country"
output: html_document

This code pulls from original commits data and groups by slug and country so that repos per country can be calculated in the 2nd file.

```{sql }
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS gh.commits_by_repo_cc AS (
SELECT slug, country_code, COUNT(*) AS commits, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions
FROM (SELECT slug, 
	  commits.login, 
	  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM committed_date)::int AS YEAR, 
	  users_gh_cc.country_code AS country_code, 
	  additions, deletions
	  FROM gh.commits 
	  FULL JOIN github.users_gh_cc 
	  ON commits.login = users_gh_cc.login) A
GROUP BY slug, A.country_code
); 
```

This does the same thing but also includes login in the group by so we get: commits by login, country code and repo.

```{sql }
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.commits_by_ctr_cc AS (
SELECT login, country_code, COUNT(*) AS commits, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions
FROM (SELECT slug, 
	  commits.login, 
	  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM committed_date)::int AS YEAR, 
	  users_gh_cc.country_code AS country_code, 
	  additions, deletions
	  FROM gh.commits 
	  FULL JOIN github.users_gh_cc 
	  ON commits.login = users_gh_cc.login
	  LIMIT 500) A
GROUP BY login, A.country_code
LIMIT 500
);
```

```{sql}

--- should double check with bay to make sure this is right but i think this is sna_intl_ctr_nodelist

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.sna_intl_ctr_nodelist AS (
SELECT login, COUNT(*) AS commits, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions, country_code, country_code_di, country_code_vis
FROM (SELECT slug, 
    commits.login, 
	  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM committed_date)::int AS YEAR, 
	  additions, deletions,
	  login_ctry_codes.country_code AS country_code, 
	  login_ctry_codes.country_code_di,
	  login_ctry_codes.country_code_vis
	  FROM gh.commits 
	  FULL JOIN gh.login_ctry_codes
	  ON commits.login = login_ctry_codes.login) A
WHERE A.country_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY login, A.country_code, A.country_code_di, A.country_code_vis
);
```

```{sql}
