Then, we write our full nodelist with attributes. 

```{sql}

--NEXT WE WANT TO CREATE A NODELIST WITH ATTRIBUTES (sna_ctr_nodelist)
--This code selects the login, commit count, number of repos each login commmitted to, and total additions and deletions. 
--It also pulls country_code data from "login_ctry_codes" which is a table created in the 02_intl-network-construction.Rmd file.

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.sna_ctr_nodelist_full AS (
SELECT A.login, repos, commits, additions, deletions, country_code, country_code_di, country_code_vis
FROM (SELECT login, COUNT(*) AS commits, COUNT(DISTINCT slug) AS repos, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions
	  FROM gh.commits_pre
	  GROUP BY login) A
LEFT JOIN gh.login_ctry_codes AS B
ON A.login = B.login
);

```

If we wanted to create dynamic nodelists with attributes based on any given year we would use this: 

```{sql}

--NEXT WE WANT TO CREATE A NODELIST WITH ATTRIBUTES FOR EACH YEAR (sna_ctr_nodelist_yxy)
--THIS TAKES THE EXACT SAME CODE AS THE LAST SNIPPET AND ADDS A YEAR TO THE GROUP_BY 

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.sna_ctr_nodelist_yxy AS (
SELECT A.login, year, repos, commits, additions, deletions, country_code, country_code_di, country_code_vis
FROM (SELECT login, COUNT(*) AS commits, COUNT(DISTINCT slug) AS repos, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM committed_date)::int AS YEAR
	  FROM gh.commits 
	  GROUP BY login, year) A
LEFT JOIN gh.login_ctry_codes AS B
ON A.login = B.login
);

```

And then filter from this year-by-year: 

```{sql }

-- THIS CODE PULLS FROM THE PREVIOUS TABLE AND JUST FILTERS BASED ON YEAR 
-- YOU WOULD CHANGE THE YEAR FOR ALL APPLICABLE YEARS 

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.sna_ctr_nodelist_2008 AS (
SELECT login, year, repos, commits, additions, deletions, country_code, country_code_di, country_code_vis
FROM   gh.sna_ctr_nodelist_yxy
WHERE  year = '2008'  
);

```
