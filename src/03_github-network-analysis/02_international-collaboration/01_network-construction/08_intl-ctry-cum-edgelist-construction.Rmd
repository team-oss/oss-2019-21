title: "International Contributor + Country Edgelist Construction"
output: html_document
---

In this file, we draw from the cumulative contributor edgelists, filter all nodes that do not have country_codes, removing all of the self-loops on the cintributor level, re-assigning all of the contributors with country_codes to their countries, and then outputting to edgelists in PostgreSQL. 

```{r loading edgelist data, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
# load packages 
for (pkg in c("tidyverse", "igraph", "data.table", "R.utils", "RPostgreSQL", "countrycode",
              "cowplot", "maditr", "lubridate", "igraph")) {library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)}
# connect to postgresql to get data (in rivanna)
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))
# query the bipartite edgelist data from github data  
ctr_nodelist <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT login, country_code_vis
                                  FROM gh.sna_ctr_ctry_codes")
ctr_nodelist <- ctr_nodelist %>% rename(country_code = country_code_vis)
# query the bipartite edgelist data from github data  
ctr_edgelist <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT ctr1, ctr2, repo_wts 
                                  FROM gh.sna_ctr_edgelist_08")
# disconnect from postgresql
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

```{r}
# some ctrs used continents in location data. let's remove that by 
# creating a list and defining a %notin% function to remove them. 
omitted_geographies <- c("europe", "asia", "africa", "americas", "multiple")
`%notin%` <- Negate(`%in%`)

# removes our list of omitted_geographies & NAs 
intl_ctr_nodelist <- ctr_nodelist %>% 
  drop_na(country_code) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(country_code = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = country_code,
                                      pattern = ","), paste("multiple"), no = country_code)) %>% 
  filter(country_code %notin% omitted_geographies)
# join the country_codes to ctr_edgelist
intl_ctr_edgelist <- ctr_edgelist %>% 
  # removes all of the self-loops between individuals 
  # this is needed on the country level bc we do not want individual self-loops but we do want within country collaborations 
  filter(ctr1 != ctr2) %>% 
  rename(login = ctr1) %>% 
  inner_join(intl_ctr_nodelist, by = "login") %>% 
  rename(ctr1 = login, ctrycode1 = country_code) %>% 
  select(ctr1, ctrycode1, ctr2, repo_wts) 
# this joins cc to original edgelist, gets longer bc of multiple ctry_codes
# join the country_codes to ctr_edgelist
intl_ctr_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  rename(login = ctr2) %>% 
  inner_join(intl_ctr_nodelist, by = "login") %>% 
  rename(ctr2 = login, ctrycode2 = country_code) %>%  
  select(ctr1, ctrycode1, ctr2, ctrycode2, repo_wts) 
# changing country codes to country name 
intl_ctr_edgelist$country1 <- countrycode(intl_ctr_edgelist$ctrycode1, 
                                      origin = 'iso2c', 
                                      destination = 'country.name')
intl_ctr_edgelist$country2 <- countrycode(intl_ctr_edgelist$ctrycode2, 
                                      origin = 'iso2c', 
                                      destination = 'country.name')
# changing Kosovo to have a valid country name 
intl_ctr_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  mutate(country1 = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = ctrycode1, 
                          pattern = "xk"), yes = "Kosovo", no = country1)) %>%  
  mutate(country2 = ifelse(test = str_detect(string = ctrycode2, 
                          pattern = "xk"), yes = "Kosovo", no = country2)) %>% 
  select(ctr1, ctrycode1, country1, ctr2, ctrycode2, country2, repo_wts) 
#create sna_intl_ctr_edgelist
sna_intl_ctr_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  select(ctr1, ctr2, repo_wts)
#create sna_intl_ctry_edgelist
sna_intl_ctry_edgelist <- intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  select(country1, country2, repo_wts) %>% 
  group_by(country1, country2) %>% 
  summarise(repo_wts = sum(repo_wts))
sna_intl_ctry_edgelist 
```

Let's take a look at the degree distributions to see if the samples compare. 

```{r}
ctr_edgelist %>% 
  count(repo_wts) %>% 
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  filter(repo_wts < 500) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=repo_wts, y=count)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
intl_ctr_edgelist %>% 
  count(repo_wts) %>% 
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  filter(repo_wts < 500) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=repo_wts, y=count)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
sna_intl_ctry_edgelist %>% 
  count(repo_wts) %>% 
  rename(count = n) %>% 
  filter(repo_wts < 500) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=repo_wts, y=count)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

Before we write these edgelists to the database, let's make sure that these can be converted to networks in igraph. igraph requires the nodelist and edgelist to match when you draw from both and I find this to be a good test that all the data is aligned. 

```{r}
# makes network 
intl_ctry_network <- graph.data.frame(sna_intl_ctry_edgelist, directed = FALSE)
# extract the nodelist from our new network  
sna_intl_ctr_nodelist <- data.frame(id = c(1:(igraph::vcount(intl_ctry_network))), 
                                    login = igraph::V(intl_ctry_network)$name)
# counting the number of isolates 
gorder(intl_ctry_network) 
gsize(intl_ctry_network)
sum(degree(simplify(intl_ctry_network))==0)
mean(degree(intl_ctry_network))
#degree(intl_ctr_network)
```

Now that we know the nodelists and edgelists converge to form networks, we can write them to the database.

```{r writing_intl_edgelist, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# connect to postgresql to get data (in rivanna)
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))
# write the edgelist to the database
dbWriteTable(conn, name = c(schema = "gh" , name = "sna_intl_ctry_edgelist_08"), 
             value = sna_intl_ctry_edgelist, row.names = FALSE, temporary = TRUE)
# disconnect from postgresql
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

# Note that the contributor and country nodelists are in 02_international-collaboration > 01_data-cleaning folder.
