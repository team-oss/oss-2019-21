### README - GitHub Network Data

The GitHub network data was constructed from the raw GitHub commits data (`gh.commits_raw`). The commits table contains all commit activity from GitHub data spanning 2008 (GitHub's start date) to the end of 2019. The `gh.commits_raw` data contains all users that commit to OSI-approved licenses and the files in this folder take that commit data and projects the data into a format where all users (ctr1, ct2) that contribute to common repositories are connected by ties (i.e. listed next to each other in adjacent columns) that are both weighted and time-specific. The first step in this process is creating a year-by-year collaboration edgelist and then created 11 different tables for cumulative collaboration activity. 

### GitHub file structure: 

    01_full-github-network
    ├── 01_github-network-data-construction
        ├── 01_full-ctr-network-construction-dev.Rmd
            - This details the network construction development process (redundant with the SQL files).
        ├── GitHub year-by-year networks 
            ├── sna_ctr_edgelist_xyx.sql 
                - This creates the edgelist for collaboration in a year-by-year fashion. 
            ├── sna_ctr_nodelist_xyx.sql 
                - This pulls out all of the distinct nodes from the edgelist and creates a nodelist. 
        ├── GitHub cumulative networks 
            ├── sna_ctr_edgelist_08.sql : sna_ctr_edgelist_0819.sql
                - These files write edgelists for cumulative activity from 2008-2019.
            ├── sna_ctr_nodelist_full.sql
                - This pulls out all of the distinct nodes from the 2008-2019 edgelist and creates a nodelist.
