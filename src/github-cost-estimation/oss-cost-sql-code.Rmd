In this snippet, I am creating a new table in PostgreSQL that joins the raw commit data from GH Torrent with the country codes that I recoded for the network analyses. Below, this data creates a new table (commit_data_cc). 

```{sql}
--checking to see if commits_summary & commits_data match (they do!)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT slug)
FROM commits_data;
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT slug)
FROM commits_summary; 
```

```{sql}
--create merged table 
create table github.commit_data_cc as (
SELECT slug, commit_data.login, year, users_gh_cc.country_code, additions, deletions, (additions + deletions) AS add_lines, (additions - deletions) AS sub_lines
FROM github.commit_data
FULL JOIN github.users_gh_cc
ON commit_data.login = users_gh_cc.login
);
GRANT ALL ON github.commit_data_cc to {gkorkmaz, jbs3hp};  
```

```{sql}
--checking to see if commits_summary & commits_data_cc match (they do not bc valid cc's reduces distinct logins)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT slug)
FROM commit_data_cc; 
```

Drawing from that table, we create a new table that is grouped by slug. 

```{sql cars}
--create merged table 
create table github.forcost_bylogin2 as (
SELECT slug, login, country_code, COUNT(*), SUM(additions) as additions, SUM(deletions) as deletions
FROM github.commit_data_cc
GROUP BY slug, login, country_code
);
GRANT ALL ON github.commit_data_cc to {gkorkmaz, jbs3hp}; 
```

And then another that is grouped by country code. 

```{sql cars}
--create merged table 
create table github.forcost_bycc2 as (
SELECT slug, country_code, COUNT(*), SUM(additions) as additions, SUM(deletions) as deletions
FROM github.commit_data_cc
GROUP BY slug, country_code
); 
GRANT ALL ON github.commit_data_cc to {gkorkmaz, jbs3hp}; 
```
