Now lets write this YXY edgelist to the database. 

```{r writing_intl_edgelist, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# connect to postgresql to get data (in rivanna)
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))

# write the edgelist to the database
dbWriteTable(conn, name = c(schema = "gh_sna" , name = "sna_intl_ctry_edgelist_yxy_refined"), 
             value = sna_intl_ctry_edgelist, row.names = FALSE, temporary = TRUE)

# disconnect from postgresql
dbDisconnect(conn)

```
