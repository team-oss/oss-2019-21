# OSS 2020 

Update: 1/22/2020

This repository has two general facets: cost estimation and network analysis for GitHub. 

**github-cost-estimation**

Gizem will update this.

**github-network-analysis**

In this folder, there are three types of analyses that we conduct: (1) network analysis on all GitHub data, (2) network analysis on international collaboration on GitHub, and (3) network analysis on users connected to specific organizations. We provide a more detailed description of these files in each folder.
