### Open Source Software 2020 Data 

In this project, we mostly rely on GitHub data to tell us about how OSS developers do their thing. For that reason, our data is usually stored on a PostgreSQL database. In each of the `src/_analysis` folders, we added a README that documents what the relevant tables are for those analyses.This README is really just informing future us about that documentation and documenting some random data files that are built up from wrangling.
